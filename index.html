        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Recently graduated with BA degree in English Literature,
          Film, and a certificate in Local Food Systems. Ten years of
          experience in hospitality and food service
          industry. Additional experience in organizing events,
          managing calendars and coordinating groups.  Strong customer
          service and organizational skills. Ability to learn concepts
          quickly.  Endless curiosity and desire to improve. Good
          communication and work ability in fast-paced environments. I
          like to have a lot to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have made sure to work for places where quality is a
          passion because I believe that a good product can be
          revolutionary. I am very experienced in the restaurant
          industry. Food is a personal passion of mine and I have
          tried to gain experience in as many aspects of this industry
          as possible. I’ve worked in kitchens, I’ve been a server and
          I learned the art of being a barista in my most recent
          job. For a year I worked on an organic farm and then woofed
          in France to cultivate an intimate knowledge of the food
          process from beginning to presentation. To me food is a
          special type of relationship and a restaurant with integrity
          has incredible influence on that relationship. I want to
          work somewhere that is inspired by the dynamics at work in
          this part of human culture and I am trying to find work with
          you because I feel I have something to learn from your
          process.
