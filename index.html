        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>
          Amanda is a multitalented Barista, Server and Cook with a
          passion for quality, locality, the seasonal and unexpected
          pairings. She has over ten years of experience in the
          hospitality and food service industries and is proud to have
          served at one of the top-rated beer establishments in the
          country, and more recently at one of the finest cafes in Los
          Angeles.
        </p>
        <p>
          She adores cinema, books and ideas which led her to pursue a
          BA in English and Film at UGA which she completed in
          2014. Around that she enjoyed a multitude of extracurricular
          activities, among them: rowing for the UGA team, pottery,
          painting, cooking, yoga, guitar, ukelele and voice, and many
          other crafts.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is especially passionate about food, its relationship to
          the self and to the environment. She has sought to gain
          experience in as many aspects of the industry as possible
          from organic farm to table. It is her dream to one day own a
          kitchen or food cart that embodies all of her loves.
        </p>
        <p>
          She loves ideas, beautiful things and talking to people.
        </p>
        <p>
          She likes to have a lot to do.
